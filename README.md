# Introduction

Enter the Gungeon has an issue with its co-op but it's innocently done. The logic goes like this:

1. If there are two players there is more damage coming out so we need to balance the game to maintain the challenge.
2. We can't raise enemy damage because the player only has 6 health, so taking two health per hit will devastate any run.
3. Therefore we will raise enemy health (by 1.4 times).
4. Also we will need to implement some sort of revive mechanic so one player isn't just gone forever.

The issue arises in practice: 
1. Chests still only give one item, but enemies have more health.
2. So you use up more ammo to defeat them, but only have the resources meant for one player.
3. This results in both players using the default gun almost all the way throughout the entire game except on bosses. In a game about interesting guns, the players cannot use guns.
4. Dying replaces chests with a "rescue" chest that respawns the dead player. Further depriving players of guns/resources.
5. No difficulty or balance is worth compromising the foundational concept of the game, therefore this mod was created.

This mod attempts to address this by:
- Doubling all chest rewards. They will drop two items instead of one (except rainbow chests). This might result in the same item but usually won't, as the drop table is rolled separately for each item.
- Increase chance of room rewards by 1.5 times. 2 times was out of control. At 1.5 you will have enough money to keep up with buying keys and maybe you will get more but that's more luck dependent. This may make things a bit easier, though I found that even with both characters capable of using guns, the 1.4 health increase for enemies still drained resources.
